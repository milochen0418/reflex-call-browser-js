# reflex-call-browser-js
Make sure to install `reflex==0.2.0`
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Explain
We rewrite window.alert in the frontend.  
So that we have a easy way to verify our frontend code has the ability to call browser-side js.   
Then we can start to make a new special event in the reflex framework to support something like
`call_browser_js`

This small project makes for solving step 2 for this issue
